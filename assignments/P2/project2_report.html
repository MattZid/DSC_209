      <h2>
        Proposition: Migration Does Not Contribute to American Economic Hardship

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="./pro_chart_v.jpg" alt="pro chart" width="700" />
          <figcaption>
            CPI rates and migration have trended idependently from each other
            for decades.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I visualized the full historial trends to visualize low correlation
            between the two features (+2)
          </li>
          <li>
            I highlighted two periods: one period where CPI rates were high
            while migration was low, and another period where the opposite is
            true to clarify my proposition. I considered taking the mean of both
            features across two spans of time to simpify this comparison but
            opted for a more intuitive, clearer solution. (+1)
          </li>
          <li>
            I annotated the highest CPI rate and lowest CPI rate in the
            visualization that both inversely trend with migration(+0.5)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="./con_chart_v.jpg" alt="" width="700" />
          <figcaption>
            Comparing recent CPI rate trends against 1970, inflation has
            significantly eased along with less migration.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I used a bar chart to compare two years rather than overall trends
            to obscure the true relationship between these features. I thought
            about adjusting my Y-axes so they visibly trended closer but I
            decided that a bar chart is more powerful in its simplicity and
            ability to support a skewed perspective. Especially because bar
            charts are not a recommended chart type for time trended data. (-2)
          </li>
          <li>
            I used a gradient for the CPI rate bar to emphasize the negative
            association with higher inflation(-1)
          </li>
          <li>
            I adjusted the scale of the CPI Annual % Change Y-axis in order to
            emphasize the change over time (-1)
          </li>
          <li>
            I annotated the visualization with the CPI rate in 1970 and 2020 to
            make the difference in values even more clear(-0.5)
          </li>
          <li>
            I calculated the improvement in CPI rate to strengthen my narrative
            (-0.5)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          I found this project more difficult than I expected. From the World
          Bank database I manually pulled individual datasets for a variety of
          features that are often referenced in news articles, such as CPI,
          crime rates, immigration, employment rates, and others. I wanted to
          focus my submission on the United States only. Given that each dataset
          was organized so that each row was a country’s data, I extracted the
          row item for the United States in each dataset and transposed the
          subset so that the yearly granularity metric data was now organized as
          a single column. I completed this for each dataset then merged each
          USA filtered subset into an aggregated USA dataframe.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here I investigated trends and I decided to focus on an issue
          that is frequently brought up in the news - migration and its negative
          impact. With my proposition that migration does not significantly
          impact economic hardship for Americans, I was determined to support
          this claim with ethical, objective chart design. In my “FOR the
          Proposition” chart, I wanted facts to speak for themselves. I
          visualized the entire dataset as a dual line chart. I selectively used
          annotations and highlighted key regions in this chart to make this
          proposition more clear. In my “AGAINST the Proposition” chart, I
          intentionally designed it as a bar chart to deceive the viewer that
          there is a positive correlation between migration and inflation.
          Annotations emphasize this and by using metrics I add credibility to
          this claim. The simplicity of the bar chart can be a powerful tool for
          deception because it’s so easy to interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this project, I’ve learned how important it is to use
          visualization features to reveal the truth objectively, rather than to
          manipulate data to support a personal narrative. Misleading design
          choices like using incorrect chart types, cherry picking data, or
          skewing the axes scales are inappropriate not only ethically, but also
          because they present data inaccurately.
