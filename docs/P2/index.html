      <h2>Proposition: Migration Does Not Contribute to American Economic Hardship</h2>

        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/pro_chart_v.jpg" alt="pro chart" width="700" />
          <figcaption>CPI rates and migration have trended idependently from each other for decades.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I visualized the full historial trends to visualize low correlation between the two features (+2)</li>
          <li>I highlighted two periods:  one period where CPI rates were high while migration was low, and another period where the opposite is true to clarify my proposition.  I considered taking the mean 
           of both features across two spans of time to simpify this comparison but opted for a more intuitive, clearer solution. (+1)</li>
          <li>I annotated the highest CPI rate and lowest CPI rate in the visualization that both inversely trend with migration(+0.5)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="../images/con_chart_v.jpg" alt="" width="700"/>
          <figcaption>Comparing recent CPI rate trends against 1970, inflation has significantly eased along with less migration.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I used a bar chart to compare two years rather than overall trends to obscure the true relationship between these features.  I thought about adjusting my Y-axes so they visibly trended closer
            but I decided that a bar chart is more powerful in its simplicity and ability to support a skewed perspective.  Especially because bar charts are not a recommended chart type for time trended data.  (-2) </li>
          <li>I used a gradient for the CPI rate bar to emphasize the negative association with higher inflation(-1)</li>
          <li>I adjusted the scale of the CPI Annual % Change Y-axis in order to emphasize the change over time (-1)</li>
          <li>I annotated the visualization with the CPI rate in 1970 and 2020 to make the difference in values even more clear(-0.5)</li>
          <li>I calculated the improvement in CPI rate to strengthen my narrative (-0.5)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>  I found this project more difficult than I expected.  From the World Bank database I manually pulled individual datasets for a variety of features that are often referenced in news articles, such as CPI, crime rates, immigration, employment rates, and others.  I wanted to focus my submission on the United States only.  Given that each dataset was organized so that each row was a country’s data, I extracted the row item for the United States in each dataset and transposed the subset so that the yearly granularity metric data was now organized as a single column.  I completed this for each dataset then merged each USA filtered subset into an aggregated USA dataframe.  </p>
        <p>  From here I investigated trends and I decided to focus on an issue that is frequently brought up in the news - migration and its negative impact.  With my proposition that migration does not significantly impact economic hardship for Americans, I was determined to support this claim with ethical, objective chart design.  In my “FOR the Proposition” chart, I wanted facts to speak for themselves.  I visualized the entire dataset as a dual line chart.  I selectively used annotations and highlighted key regions in this chart to make this proposition more clear.  In my “AGAINST the Proposition” chart, I intentionally designed it as a bar chart to deceive the viewer that there is a positive correlation between migration and inflation.  Annotations emphasize this and by using metrics I add credibility to this claim.  The simplicity of the bar chart can be a powerful tool for deception because it’s so easy to interpret. </p>
        <p>  From this project, I’ve learned how important it is to use visualization features to reveal the truth objectively, rather than to manipulate data to support a personal narrative.  Misleading design choices like using incorrect chart types, cherry picking data, or skewing the axes scales are inappropriate not only ethically, but also because they present data inaccurately.</p>
